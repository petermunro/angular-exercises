# Template-Driven Forms

## 1. Create a Template-Driven Form

Create a template-driven form to handle the following scenario:

> An e-commerce company needs clients to be able to register online.

The form should enable the following data to be collected:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Country
- Email Address
- Password
- Confirm Password
- I agree to the Terms and Conditions
- Day and Month of Birth

- The validation should check the following:
  - First Name, Last Name and Email are required. Country is optional.
  - Email addresses are of the correct format.
  - Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.
  - The Terms and Conditions must be agreed to.

## 2. Update to Requirements

The client has asked you to modify the form to support a new requirement. The form is now to be used as part of a shopping cart checkout process.

Part of this process involves the customer adding their shipping and billing addresses.

Without writing code, do the following:

1. Mock up a sample user interface on a sheet of paper.
2. Write down what would need to change in your code to support this new requirement.
