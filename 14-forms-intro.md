# Introducing Forms

## Understanding `FormControl`

The properties listed below don't match their descriptions. Match the descriptions to the correct properties.

| Form Control Property | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. `pristine`         | 1. an object containing any errors generated by failing validation (or `null` if there are no errors)                                           |
| 2. `touched`          | 2. `true` if this control has failed one or more of its validation checks, `false` otherwise                                                    |
| 3. `valid`            | 3. a multicasting observable that emits an event every time the value of the control changes, in the UI or programmatically                     |
| 4. `disabled`         | 4. `true` once the user has interacted with the form control (triggered a `blur` event on it)                                                   |
| 5. `errors`           | 5. a multicasting observable that emits an event every time the validation `status` of the control recalculates                                 |
| 6. `invalid`          | 6. if the control has not been marked as touched                                                                                                |
| 7. `valueChanges`     | 7. `true` if the user has not yet changed the value in the UI                                                                                   |
| 8. `statusChanges`    | 8. `true` if the user has changed the value of this control in the UI                                                                           |
| 9. `dirty`            | 9. `true` if the control has passed all of its validation tests, `false` otherwise                                                              |
| 10. `untouched`       | 10. the control is exempt from validation checks, its value is not included in parent values, and it is typically not available for interaction |

## Creating a Hierarchy of Form Controls

This exercise aims to help you understand `FormControl` and `FormGroup`. The form controls won't be displayed in the DOM, but you'll see that you can instantiate them and that they

1.  Create a new component, for example `MyFormComponent`

2.  Add an instance variable `registerForm`:

        registerForm: FormGroup;

3.  In your component's constructor, instantiate a `FormGroup` containing two `FormControl`s:

          this.registerForm = new FormGroup({
            name: new FormControl(""),
            email: new FormControl("")
          });

4)  Also in the constructor, display the form's value:

          console.log(this.registerForm.value);

5)  Test and make sure that the console displays the `FormGroup`'s value.

6)  To interact with the `FormGroup` in the console, add this to your constructor:

           window.registerForm = this.registerForm;

    Which properties are available within `registerForm`? (Type CTRL-SPACE after typing `registerForm` to view.)

    Now in the browser console, disable the `email` control:

           registerForm.controls.email.disable();

    What effect does this have on the `FormGroup`s `value`?

    Is the `FormGroup` 'valid'?

7. How would you model a data entry form for a contact list, where each row contains a Name, Email, and Phone?
