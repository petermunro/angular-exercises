# DI and Services

1. Create the PlayService.

2. Create a component that renders the list of plays (`PlayListComponent`).
   You will need to inject the PlayService into this component's constructor.

3. Make sure the plays are rendered.

4. Create a `NewPlayComponent` that enables you to add a new play.

5. Have this component rendered in the app on the same page as the
   `PlayListComponent`. Ensure that when you add a new play, it is rendered
   in the (sibling) `PlayListComponent`.
