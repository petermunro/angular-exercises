# Working with Components

1. Create a new component file, and decorate it with the metadata fields `selector` and `template` (the template will be inline).

Have your template display a simple message.

Include the new component in your main app. Ensure you add it to the app's `NgModule` to make it available to the module's components.

2. Add styles to the new component.
