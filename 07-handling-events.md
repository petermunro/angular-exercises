# Handling Events

1. Create a CounterComponent. This should have two buttons (up/down or increment/decrement) which change the value of the counter by one in the direction chosen.

2. Create a component that tracks the current mouse location within an element and displays the cursor coordinates whenever the mouse moves.


## Using Events with Property Binding

Write a `SelectImageComponent`. This should display an `<img>` element and four buttons. Each button chooses a different image, and when clicked, the `<img>` element should display the chosen image. Some images are available for you in [images/]().
